Project Short Description:
==============================
While menstruation is a normal, natural process, in our country it is viewed as a thing to be hidden from the public eye. It is often seen as a monthly ‘disease’ that does not warrant any discussion or special focus. It is this attitude that leads to a lack of awareness about menstrual health and hygiene, resulting in poor menstrual practice that deeply affect women’s health and their participation in daily activities. Lack of proper public toilet facilities, affordable sanitary products and comprehensive knowledge on the subject has further compounded the problem of poor menstrual health and hygiene.
